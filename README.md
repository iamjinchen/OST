Preparation

#### pacakges, datasets, and running scripts
Same as that in [SLADD](https://github.com/liangchen527/SLADD):

#### pretrained weights
Download [Xception](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2EHgj7EW2RsfiqvtbnQSIvLkbVgDFlZ/view?usp=sharing) pretrained weights and [dlib](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DB5-AsWHBpfprMccNt_6U0S1gl2L-5Zk/view?usp=sharing) landmark predictor and put them in the weights folder.

Please emial me directly (<liangchen527@gmail.com>) if you have any questions or any feedback (since I no longer work on the deepfake detection task, issues in this project may no longer be resolved).
